            "Q1: **How can we effectively measure and mitigate the emergent risks of unintended goal-directed behavior in increasingly complex agentic AI systems, beyond simple benchmark tasks and controlled environments?**  (This question focuses on the crucial issue of robustness and safety in real-world deployment, going beyond lab settings.)\n",
            "Q2: **What are the ethical and societal implications of delegating increasingly complex decision-making processes to agentic AI systems, particularly concerning issues of accountability, transparency, and the potential for bias amplification?** (This addresses the broader societal context and challenges inherent in entrusting AI with significant power.)\n",
            "Q3: **Beyond reward maximization, what alternative frameworks for specifying and evaluating the goals and behaviors of agentic AI systems are necessary to ensure alignment with human values and avoid instrumental convergence towards undesirable outcomes?** (This explores the limitations of current reward-based approaches and seeks innovative solutions for goal specification.)\n",
            "Q4: **How can we develop robust methods for verifying and validating the internal representations and reasoning processes of agentic AI systems, enabling a better understanding of their decision-making and facilitating the detection of potential flaws or biases?**  (This delves into the \"black box\" problem and the need for explainable and verifiable AI.)\n",
            "Q5: **What are the key technical challenges in developing agentic AI systems capable of long-term planning, adaptation, and learning in open-ended, dynamic environments, and how can these challenges be addressed through interdisciplinary collaboration between AI, cognitive science, and other relevant fields?** (This emphasizes the need for a multi-faceted approach encompassing technical, cognitive, and potentially even philosophical perspectives.)\n",
